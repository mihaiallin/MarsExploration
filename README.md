Experience a simulated Mars exploration mission where a spaceship touches down on the Martian surface. Upon landing, a rover is dispatched to scour the terrain for valuable resources. Once the rover identifies an area rich in the required resources, it initiates the construction of a Command Center, where all the collected resources are stored.
